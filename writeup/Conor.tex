These three examples show the main drawback of D-CAPT compared to C-CAPT, which is that since points are not assigned optimally at the start, there can be extremely non-optimal paths. Other drawbacks include that the number of robots must equal the goal points (however we implemented a small extension to allow this), the inital assignment problem must be unique without a centralized controller, and that networking and precedence creates a leyer of complexity in robot-to-robot communication.
